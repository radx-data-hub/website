[The RADx Data Hub](https://radx-hub.nih.gov/) represents one of the largest collections of NIH COVID data available to researchers that allows researchers to explore, access, and analyze COVID-related data developed through [NIH RADx program initiatives](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs). In December, NIH released two new Notices of Special Interest ([NOT-OD-23-040](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-040.html) and [NOT-OD-23-041](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-041.html)) that support scientific inquiry using existing data resources in the RADx Data Hub. \n \n On January 23, 2023 from 1:00-2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, researchers are invited to [tour the RADx Data Hub](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_L1FMUEp6QMSjlipjrzCPXg). This tour will feature an overview of the RADx Data Hub program and its portfolio, a demonstration of RADx Data Hub capabilities, and an open question and answer session. The webinar will be recorded and made available to those who register for it.",
